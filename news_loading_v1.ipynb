Ukraine — A Russian force advancing on Kyiv fired mortar shells on Sunday at a battered bridge used by evacuees fleeing the fighting, sending panicked civilians running and leaving four people dead on the pavement.Crowds of hundreds have clustered around the damaged bridge over the Irpin River since Saturday. Ukrainian forces had blown up the bridge earlier to slow the Russian advance. Only a dozen or so Ukrainian soldiers were in the immediate area of the bridge on Sunday, not fighting but helping carry civilians’ luggage and children.To cross a hundred yards or so of exposed street on the side of the bridge closer to Kyiv, people seeking to flee to the capital formed small groups and made a run for it together. Soldiers ran out, picked up children or luggage, and ran for cover behind a cinder block wall.The mortar shells fell first 100 or so yards from the bridge, then shifted in a series of thunderous blasts into a section of street where people were fleeing. A New York Times team — including the photojournalist Lynsey Addario; a security adviser; and Andriy Dubchak, the freelance journalist who filmed the scene — witnessed the moment that civilians were fired upon.As the mortars got closer to the stream of civilians, people ran, pulling children, trying to find a safe spot. But there was nothing to hide behind. A shell landed in the street, sending up a cloud of concrete dust and leaving one family — a woman, her teenage son and a her daughter, who appeared to be about 8 years old; and a family friend — sprawled on the ground.Soldiers rushed to help, but the woman and children were dead. A man traveling with them still had a pulse but was unconscious and severely wounded. He later died.Their luggage, a blue roller suitcase and some backpacks, was scattered about, along with a green carrying case for a small dog that was barking.Ukrainian forces were engaged in clashes nearby, but not at the site where civilians were moving along the street. Outgoing mortar rounds could be heard from a Ukrainian position about 200 yards away.The shelling suggested either targeting of the evacuation routes from Irpin, something of which the Ukrainian authorities have accused the Russian army after a railroad track used for evacuations was hit on Saturday, or disregard for the risk of civilian casualties.Russian forces have for days been pushing through three small towns on Kyiv’s northwestern rim, Hostomel, Bucha and Irpin, and the fighting has driven evacuees from the area toward the capital.Early Sunday morning, the city’s military commander, Oleksiy Kuleba, said in a televised statement that the routes out were so unsafe as to be in effect blocked. “Unfortunately, unless there is a cease-fire,” people could not get out, he said.But civilians were still trying to escape, first to Kyiv and then hopefully to somewhere safer in the western part of the country.Soldiers at the site also assisted a wounded member of the Territorial Defense Forces, the organization coordinating armed volunteers in the defense of the city. He had been shot in an arm.'}"]},"execution_count":84,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["news_json = get_most_viewed_30()\n","news_json['data'][0]"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3db884ae-69e0-4837-9ae0-37b26138f660","metadata":{"tags":[],"id":"3db884ae-69e0-4837-9ae0-37b26138f660"},"source":["# get {year}/{month} news"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4b509ff5-0e76-4681-a051-f776793873f2","metadata":{"tags":[],"id":"4b509ff5-0e76-4681-a051-f776793873f2"},"source":["# try 1"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"0bc7ee31-d48a-43ad-9149-b6bf22fe6405","metadata":{"id":"0bc7ee31-d48a-43ad-9149-b6bf22fe6405"},"outputs":[],"source":["monthly_news = 'https://api.nytimes.com/svc/archive/v1/2022/2.json?api-key='"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"bb53f8fb-2d74-467b-b0c5-d7cd577201f0","metadata":{"id":"bb53f8fb-2d74-467b-b0c5-d7cd577201f0"},"outputs":[],"source":["json_data = news_get_request(monthly_news)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"d18149da-7c89-44db-b2d6-69cf5120fe61","metadata":{"id":"d18149da-7c89-44db-b2d6-69cf5120fe61","outputId":"5a6cd642-d9df-4c67-e623-2294c7a1630d"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["dict_keys(['abstract', 'web_url', 'snippet', 'lead_paragraph', 'print_section', 'print_page', 'source', 'multimedia', 'headline', 'keywords', 'pub_date', 'document_type', 'news_desk', 'section_name', 'byline', 'type_of_material', '_id', 'word_count', 'uri'])"]},"execution_count":93,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["json_data['response']['docs'][0].keys()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"020b3e77-b37f-4a83-86bc-4b8e0417b402","metadata":{"id":"020b3e77-b37f-4a83-86bc-4b8e0417b402"},"outputs":[],"source":["data = {}"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"15d3e3ca-b0a4-4e4e-ab95-0b0b268e1120","metadata":{"id":"15d3e3ca-b0a4-4e4e-ab95-0b0b268e1120","outputId":"20fc0782-b2aa-4a03-f727-05efe36716fa"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["'The push to make Americans’ lives nasty, brutish and short.'"]},"execution_count":94,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["json_data['response']['docs'][0]['abstract'] # abstrct"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"b028bbcb-e66a-4827-a664-3afe58936be9","metadata":{"id":"b028bbcb-e66a-4827-a664-3afe58936be9"},"outputs":[],"source":["data['abstract'] = json_data['response']['docs'][0]['abstract']"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"ec2d396f-d127-4458-9156-e4052b133131","metadata":{"id":"ec2d396f-d127-4458-9156-e4052b133131","outputId":"a86d10ba-79da-41b1-b4cf-a3ab17b45429"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["'https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/31/opinion/republican-misinformation-coronavirus.html'"]},"execution_count":95,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["json_data['response']['docs'][0]['web_url'] # url"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"b2b67790-8ba0-41d5-b67a-c71e0e1bc094","metadata":{"id":"b2b67790-8ba0-41d5-b67a-c71e0e1bc094"},"outputs":[],"source":["url = json_data['response']['docs'][0]['web_url']\n","data['url'] = url"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"64088bda-193a-4e83-91e9-aae3508f10ca","metadata":{"id":"64088bda-193a-4e83-91e9-aae3508f10ca","outputId":"dd5c67c7-e1e3-4b8d-92fe-1e8f73021ce1"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["'The push to make Americans’ lives nasty, brutish and short.'"]},"execution_count":96,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["json_data['response']['docs'][0]['snippet']"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"19cb1c02-16c6-4d4e-bc2a-e80efd52ec18","metadata":{"id":"19cb1c02-16c6-4d4e-bc2a-e80efd52ec18","outputId":"e2c187cd-e963-43c6-a919-ab77ffd44afc"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["'In February 2021 a deep freeze caused widespread power outages in Texas, leaving about 10 million Texans without electricity, in many cases for days.

Hundreds died.The biggest proximate cause of the crisis was disrupted production of natural gas, the state’s most important power source. After a 2011 freeze, federal regulators had urged Texas to require winterization of gas and electricity facilities. But it didn’t.And for the most part it still hasn’t: So far, no winterization requirements have been placed on the politically powerful gas sector. Instead, Gov. Greg Abbott is hoping to secure the power grid by encouraging … Bitcoin mining. This would supposedly reduce the risk of outages because Bitcoin’s huge electricity consumption would eventually expand the state’s generation capacity.Yes, that’s as crazy as it sounds. But it fits a pattern. When confronted with problems that could easily be alleviated through cooperative action, the radical right-wingers who have taken over the Republican Party often turn instead to bizarre nonsolutions that appeal to their antisocial ideology. I’ll explain why I use that word in a minute.First, let’s talk about the most obvious current example: Covid policy. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis has tried to block just about every measure intended to limit the spread of the coronavirus; he and his officials have stopped just short of being explicitly anti-vaccine, but they have catered to the anti-vax fringe, with DeSantis even refusing to say whether he has received a booster shot.They have, however, gone all in on antibody treatments that are far more expensive than vaccines, with DeSantis demanding that the Food and Drug Administration allow use of antibodies that, the F.D.A. has found, don’t work against Omicron.Why support expensive, ineffective treatments while opposing measures that would help prevent severe illness in the first place? Well, consider a parallel that may not be immediately obvious but is actually quite close: school shootings.Among major advanced nations, such shootings are an almost uniquely U.S. phenomenon. And while there may be multiple reasons America leads the world in massacres of schoolkids, we could surely mitigate the horror with common-sense measures like restrictions on gun sales, required background checks and a ban on privately owned assault weapons.But no. Republicans want to expand access to guns and, in many states, protect students by arming schoolteachers.What do these examples have in common? As Thomas Hobbes could have told you, human beings can only flourish, can only avoid a state of nature in which lives are “nasty, brutish and short,” if they participate in a “commonwealth” — a society in which government takes on much of the responsibility for making life secure. Thus, we have law enforcement precisely so individuals don’t have to go around armed to protect themselves against other people’s violence.Public health policy, if you think about it, reflects the same principle. Individuals can and should take responsibility for their own health, when they can; but the nature of infectious disease means that there is an essential role for collective action, whether it is public investment in clean water supplies or, yes, mask and vaccine mandates during a pandemic.And you don’t have to be a socialist to recognize the need for regulation to maintain the reliability of essential aspects of the economy like electricity supply and the monetary system.Which is why I’m calling the modern American right antisocial — because its members reject any policy that relies on social cooperation, and they want us to return instead to Hobbes’s dystopian state of nature. We won’t try to keep guns out of the hands of potential mass murderers; instead, we’ll rely on teacher-vigilantes to gun them down once the shooting has already started. We won’t try to limit the spread of infectious diseases; instead, we’ll tell people to take drugs that are expensive, ineffective or both after they’ve already gotten sick.What about Bitcoin? I don’t think it’s even worth trying to make sense of Abbott’s tortured logic, why he imagines that promoting an environmentally destructive, energy-hogging industry will somehow make his state’s electricity supply more reliable. (An energy grid overloaded by crypto mining helped set off the recent crisis in Kazakhstan.)A better question is why Republicans have become fanatics about cryptocurrency, to the extent that one Senate candidate has defined his position as being “pro-God, pro-family, pro-Bitcoin.” The answer, I’d argue, is that Bitcoin plays into a fantasy of self-sufficient individualism, of protecting your family with your personal AR-15, treating your Covid with an anti-parasite drug or urine and managing your financial affairs with privately created money, untainted by institutions like governments or banks.In the end, none of this will work. Government exists for a reason. But the right’s constant attacks on essential government functions will take a toll, making all of our lives nastier, more brutish and shorter.'}"]},"execution_count":164,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["data"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ec2e2cc0-bc29-4b9b-af70-8f86a2207e85","metadata":{"tags":[],"id":"ec2e2cc0-bc29-4b9b-af70-8f86a2207e85"},"source":["# function part"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"59d27eaf-4a24-4ff6-94ed-d5c0f14c1119","metadata":{"id":"59d27eaf-4a24-4ff6-94ed-d5c0f14c1119"},"outputs":[],"source":["def get_initial_news(year, month):\n","    start = time.time()\n","    request_url = 'https://api.nytimes.com/svc/archive/v1/{year}/{month}.json?api-key='.format(year = year, month = month)\n","    json_data = news_get_request(request_url)\n","    news_json = {'data' : []}\n","    raw_data = json_data['response']['docs']\n","    total = len(raw_data)\n","    i = 1\n","    for news in raw_data:\n","        start_round = time.time()\n","        data = {}\n","        # get author\n","        author = news['byline']['person']\n","        if author == []:\n","            continue\n","        else:\n","            name_comp = list(author[0].keys())[:3]\n","            author_list = []\n","            for person in author:\n","                name_list = []\n","                for comp in name_comp:\n","                    if person[comp] != None:\n","                        name_list.append(person[comp])\n","                name = ' '.join(name_list)\n","                author_list.append(name)\n","        data['author'] = author_list\n","        # get caregory\n","        section = news['section_name']\n","        data['section'] = section\n","        # get abstract\n","        data['abstract'] = news['abstract'] \n","        # get url\n","        data['url'] = url\n","        # get tital\n","        data['title'] = news['headline']['main']\n","        # get keywords\n","        kw_lsit = []\n","        for kw in news['keywords']:\n","            kw_lsit.append(kw['value'])\n","        data['keywords'] = kw_lsit\n","        # get publish date\n","        date = news['pub_date']\n","        timestamp = date.split('T')\n","        data['publish_data'] = timestamp\n","        # get id\n","        raw_id = news['_id']\n","        real_id = raw_id.split('/')[-1]\n","        data['id'] = real_id\n","        news_json['data'].append(data)\n","        end_round = time.time()\n","        print('completing------{}/{}, using time: {}'.format(i, total, end_round -
